# Orbit

This is a selection of files and previews of the basis of a game tentatively codenamed '**Orbit**', in which a player controls a _Comet_ which bounces around the orbit of various _Celestial Bodies_.

The game is made in Unity using C# scripts.

**The files showcase** my knowledge of object-oriented programming and my basic ability to use shaders to generate procedural assets, as well as some optimisation of performance.

As this is just an excerpt there will be references to many files I haven't included, and some files will be older versions that may contain errors (purposeful of course, for the reader) however if you have any queries I will be happy to answer them via my email provided on my [Portfolio](https://thomasdoyle11.github.io/).
